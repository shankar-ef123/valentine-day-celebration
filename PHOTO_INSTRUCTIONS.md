# 📸 How to Add Your Photos

I understand you want to use your own photos! I've prepared the project structure for you. Here's how to add your images:

## Option 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended)

1. Go to your project's **Files** section
2. Look for the **public/** folder
3. You'll see these empty image files:
   - `ammu_closeup.jpg` - The close-up photo of Ammu
   - `couple_butterfly.jpg` - The couple photo with butterfly filter
   - `couple_purple.jpg` - The couple photo with purple shirt/hearts filter
   - `ammu_hellokitty.jpg` - Photo of Ammu with Hello Kitty filter
   - `ammu_hearts.jpg` - Photo of Ammu with heart filters
   - `couple_redshirt.jpg` - The couple photo where she's wearing red/orange

4. **Replace** these files with your actual photos by:
   - Deleting the empty file
   - Creating a new file with the **SAME NAME**
   - Or edit the file and paste/upload your image content

## Option 2: Using the Website Interface

1. Open the website preview
2. Click the **"Customize Photos"** button (top right)
3. Click **"Upload Photo"** on each placeholder
4. Select your images from your device
5. The site will automatically save them

## Photo Mapping Guide

Based on your uploads, here's which photo goes where:

| File Name | Should Contain |
|-----------|---------------|
| `ammu_closeup.jpg` | The artistic close-up portrait of Ammu |
| `couple_butterfly.jpg` | The selfie with butterfly filter effects |
| `couple_purple.jpg` | The photo with purple/hearts overlay in vehicle |
| `ammu_hellokitty.jpg` | Ammu with Hello Kitty face filters |
| `ammu_hearts.jpg` | Ammu with floating white hearts filter |
| `couple_redshirt.jpg` | The outdoor photo where she wears red shirt |

## Troubleshooting

**Photos not showing?**
- Make sure the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Use `.jpg` extension
- If using the website interface, images are saved to your browser's local storage - they'll persist for you but not if you clear browser data

**Want to start over?**
- Clear your browser's local storage for this site
- Or refresh the page and click "Customize Photos" again
